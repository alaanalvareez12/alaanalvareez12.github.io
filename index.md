## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

* Lab 2, part 1

    This lab was the fundamentals and it really set the understanding of how to code, using std::cin and std::cout helped shape the future code. The reason why this lab is my favorite was because there was fairly no challenge and that is what made it so fun. I thought it was going to be the hardest thing on the planet and ended up not being hard at all! Making a sentence out of any verb and noun made this interactive experience so engaging.

* Lab 3, part 1

    The implementation of math into coding was a shift I expected, the math is fairly simple as we use the computers to solve it for us. We still had to add the users input to get their correct BMR, the input and coding the math made my brain a little confused but that is what made it so fun! Using my brain to figure out what went wrong after tests failed made it so rewarding when I would figure it out.

* Lab 4, part 1

    The introduction of functions created this unique interaction as I could make a function that would do the math in the background without having to create repetitive code. This made me juggle two pieces of code which was very confusing at first, however I enjoyed the satisfaction of getting no compiling errors and the program finally running. This had to be my favorite lab as I also had a lab mate that was just intrigued as I was in the world of programming.
